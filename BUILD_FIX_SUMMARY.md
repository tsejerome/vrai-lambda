# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Docker build was failing with TypeScript showing help output instead of compiling

**Error:**
```
Error: failed to fetch an image or build from source: error building: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c npx tsc" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

## Root Cause

The `.dockerignore` file was excluding essential build files:
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration file
- `types/` directory - Contains `ffmpeg.d.ts` type definitions

This meant:
- TypeScript couldn't find the configuration file
- Type definitions for FFmpeg were missing
- `npx tsc` showed help output instead of compiling
- Build process failed

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed .dockerignore
```diff
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.production.json
- types
+ # tsconfig.json  # Commented out - needed for build
+ # tsconfig.production.json  # Commented out - needed for build
+ # types  # Commented out - needed for build (contains ffmpeg.d.ts)
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Build the application with explicit TypeScript compilation
RUN npx tsc --project tsconfig.json
```

### 3. Updated GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Build application
  run: |
    npx tsc --project tsconfig.json
```

## Files Modified

1. **`.dockerignore`** - Uncommented tsconfig.json and types directory exclusions
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Added explicit project path to TypeScript compilation
3. **`.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`** - Updated build command

## Verification

✅ **Local build works:**
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Success
```

✅ **TypeScript compilation works:**
```bash
npx tsc --project tsconfig.json
# ✅ Success
```

✅ **Build output exists:**
```bash
ls -la dist/
# ✅ dist/app.js exists
```

## Next Steps

The build should now work in Fly.io. Deploy with:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Or push to trigger GitHub Actions:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Docker build: include tsconfig.json in build context"
git push origin main
```

## Prevention

- Always ensure configuration files needed for build are not excluded in `.dockerignore`
- Use explicit project paths for TypeScript compilation in Docker
- Test builds locally before deploying
